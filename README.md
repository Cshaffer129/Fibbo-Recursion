# FiboNacci
The Fibonacci numbers are named after a 13th century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci.

The two first Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and the next Fibonacci number is always the sum of the two previous numbers, so we get 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
How it works:

Start with the two first Fibonacci numbers 0 and 1.
Add the two previous numbers together to create a new Fibonacci number.
Update the value of the two previous numbers.
Do point a and b above 18 times.
